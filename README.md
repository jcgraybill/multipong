Dust off your Performa and pretend it's the 1990s shareware Macintosh gaming scene with Multi Pong!

Developed as part of the [68k Macintosh programming study group](https://tinkerdifferent.com/threads/idea-macintosh-68k-programming-study-group.1681/) on [Tinker Different](https://tinkerdifferent.com/). Build it using [Think C version 6.0](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/296-symantec-think-c-6-0). Decode/decompress the Think C project file and resource file with [Stuffit Expander](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/320-stuffit-expander-3-5-1) to use them.
