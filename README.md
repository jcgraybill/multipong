Multi-window pong game for 68k Macintosh System 7

Dust off your old Quadra and re-live the 1990s shareware Macintosh gaming experience with Multi Pong!

This was built as part of the [68k Macintosh programming study group](https://tinkerdifferent.com/threads/idea-macintosh-68k-programming-study-group.1681/) on [Tinker Different](https://tinkerdifferent.com/).

Build locally using [Think C version 6.0](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/296-symantec-think-c-6-0).
