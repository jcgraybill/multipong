Multi-window pong game for 68k Macintosh System 7

Dust off your old Quadra and relive computer gaming circa 1992 with Multi Pong! A tiny little System 7 game built in 2022.

This was built for the [68k programming study group](https://tinkerdifferent.com/threads/idea-macintosh-68k-programming-study-group.1681/) on [Tinker Different](https://tinkerdifferent.com/).

This *should* work on a pretty wide range of Macintosh System software versions, but I've presently only tested on System 7.

Build locally using [Think C version 6.0](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/296-symantec-think-c-6-0). The Think C project file and resource file you need are included in StuffIt/BinHex format, so decode/decompress these with [Stuffit Expander](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/320-stuffit-expander-3-5-1) in order to use them.
